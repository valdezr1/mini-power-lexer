# Mini-Power-Lexer
Lexical analyzer created using Python to interpret Mini-Power's EBNF grammar.

Lexical analyzers are used to grab characters and produce tokens based on a language's established grammar (usually in BNF notation). 
This program implements a lexical analyzer based on Mini-Power grammar and returns an output file (input.out) of tokens. Mini-Power EBNF
can be found commented within the lexer.py file.

Compatible with Python v.3.
